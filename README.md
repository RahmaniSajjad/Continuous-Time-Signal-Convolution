# Continuous-Time-Signal-Convolution
The code you provided is an implementation of the continuous-time signal convolution in Python, using the Matplotlib and NumPy libraries. The code allows for the visualization of the convolution process by plotting the original signals and the resulting convolution signal.

Here's a possible repository name and description for your code:

Repository name: cts-convolution-visualization
Description: This repository contains a Python implementation of the continuous-time signal convolution, with the option to visualize the convolution process using Matplotlib. The code includes examples with different input signals and allows for adjusting the accuracy of the signal sampling.
